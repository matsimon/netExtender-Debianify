This is a tiny script I hacked together with my poor bash skills.
It helps to convert the proprietary NetExtender RPMs provided by SonicWALL
and make a somewhat better Debian package out of it.

Essentally it adds some better dependency management and better cleanup after
removal.

Just download the NetExtender RPM for one or the other arch and place it in
the directory of the script.

Then run ./build-debian.sh <Name of RPM> <Version without dashes> <arch>

You will need at least:
- alien
- fakeroot
- patch
- git-core
- dpkg-dev
