README
-------
Since it's still changing a bit so patches don't apply patches 
everytime I decided to just pre-modify the postrm, postinst and
control with dependencies and pre-modify the bits.

Essentally it adds some better dependency management and better cleanup after
removal compared to the Sonicwall's package that passes alien.

Just download the NetExtender RPM for one or the other arch and place it in
the directory of the script, and launch the build-debian.sh <RPM> <targetArch>

You will need at least:
- alien
- fakeroot
- patch
- git-core
- dpkg-dev
